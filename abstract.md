We as humans care a lot about truth. We condemn lies and fell angry when someone breaks a promise. This also happens in science and investigation. Scientist often care about the truth of the sentences used. Truth is also connected with knowledge. The common assumption is that knowledge implies truth: if the sentence uttered doesn't correspond with the way the world is, _i. e_, the sentence is false, therefore you didn't knew it. But there is a problem with this common view when you try to extend it to science. The common critique to the realist stand in science is that there are historical cases that were proven to be false: the  phlogiston theory of Priestley, the theory of organical molecules of Buffon, etc. So it seems, that we have to give up the realist stance. But there is also truth involved in scientific investigation. Some examples like Newton's theory of gravitational forces, and Darwin's theory of natural selection are some examples of theories that  we, even today, use to explain physical and biological phenomena. So, what is going on here?

Of course, this problem involves various philosophical aspects. The first one is a matter of ontology: which objects are involved in scientific investigations such that they exists?; there is also an epistemic aspect: what and how can we know truth with scientific investigations?; and there is also a logical aspect: which patterns of reasoning are useful to capture this aspect of scientific investigation?

In the talk I want to try to respond to the last question. We know that there is a notion of truth involved in scientific investigation, we also know that the information that we have is fallible, so which logic is useful to tackle this problem? I will argue that the framework of Quasi-Truth  made by Da Costa is useful for this problem on the logical aspect. 

Da costa and Bueno @key have proposed a model for handling the ignorance about certain set of sentences in a theory. When the define how a partial structure $A$  is mapped into a total one $B$, they define how the relations between A & B should be mapped. For a relation $R$ to become into a full relation $R'$ we need to gatter empirical information. There is an explanation model that, combined with this formal model, can be useful for gattering this kind of information: Woodward's causal explanation model.
