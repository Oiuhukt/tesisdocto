# Apuntes sobre externalismo en historia de la ciencia

## Ahora esto... Chapín

### Shapin en A social history of truth.

Ahora voy a tener que hacer apuntes del libro de Shapin. Maldita sea.
Neta sólo quiero una cita donde diga algo explícito sobre el 
internalismo o algo así.

no encontré lo que quería, pero sí sirvió de algo.

You could say that Truth (in any precise philosophical sense) is not
a product of science, or that it is not a unique product. Or you could
say that the historian is not properly concerned with Truth but with
credibility, with whatever it is that counts as Truth in a range of 
historical settings." Esto aparece en el capítulo 1

Koyré was both enormously exciting--—imagine: science as an 
authentically historical phenomenon—--but the radicalism of his work
was partly masked by his later recruitment as the Hammer of the
Marxists. And so an authentically, and radically, historical 
sensibility about scientific thought was a marked feature of the new
"internalism" associated with the work of such great post–World 
War II historians of science as A. Rupert and Marie Boas Hall, 
I. Bernard Cohen, Richard S. Westfall. 20

Second, the end of the nineteenth century and the early twentieth 
century witnessed a range of philosophical movements, some of them 
embraced by scientists, that were either skeptical of the notion of
scientific Truth, or of certain absolutist conceptions of Truth, or,
more generally, of whether science should be making metaphysical
claims, about, for example, "correspondence" and "ultimate realities."
These movements go by various names, and in other contexts it would
be important to distinguish between them: phenom-enalism, 
operationalism, positivism, conventionalism, and, above all, 
pragmatism. But equally important is what they have in common: each
aimed to sever the links that bound early modern natural philosophy
to religion by way of metaphysics and notions of God’s Truth. Just as
the Scientific Naturalism of the late nineteenth century lowered the
case of "nature," so all of these characterizations of the quality and
character of scientific knowledge lowered the case of "truth." And 
some, indeed, quite explicitly identified the metaphysical tendencies
of religious discourse as an intellectual pathology, to be cured by
deflationary conceptions of the status of proper scientific knowledge.
Lowering the Tone in the History of science

The notion of truthfulness was thus central to the description of
gentle qualities. Through the Renaissance and into the eighteenth
century an honorable man and an honest man were interchangeable 
designations: "honesty" included the notion of truthtelling but was
understood far more broadly to include concepts of  probity,
uprightness, fair-dealing, and respectability. pp. 70-71

One could, and one ought to, attribute truthfulness to individuals
placed in positions of influence, just as one could, and one ought to,
recognize nobility and integrity in those who reliably told the 
truth. p. 72

While some courtesy texts did indeed comment upon women's unreliable
truthfulness, and while there was a sixteenth- and seventeenth century
ethical literature especially designed for a female readership,  
it cannot be said that the cultural qualifications of women were  as
such a major preoccupation of early modern (male) ethical writing.
In the main, women's conduct was addressed within a domestic context,
as might be expected in settings where institutional obstacles to 
female participation in formally political or cultural affairs were
so substantial that exclusion did not need to be elaborately 
justified. p. 87

Qué sorpresa, wey. Como si esto hubiera cambiado desde entonces.
_Nota del 21 de mayo del 2025: dije exactamente lo mismo_

The son of a gentleman could be said to make himself base by going 
into trade just because he subjected  himself to those circumstances
which would make truth-telling impossible. p. 88

Qué sorpresa, imbécil. Como si no lo hicieran en la actualidad.

As science was humanity’s highest and noblest achievement, so the 
history of science was a celebration of what had been and remained
best in human culture. Celebrating science was celebrating the small 
number of people who had made authentic and lasting discoveries. There
were many drones in science but few heroes, and the heroes were the
ones who count. The history of science, Sarton said, is "largely the
history of a few individuals." 

## Never pure 

The study of credibility then became simply coextensive with the study
of knowledge, including scientific knowledge. In sociological terms of
art, an individual’s belief (or an individual’s claim) was contrasted
to collectively held knowledge. The individual’s belief did not become
collective—and so part of knowledge—until and unless it had won 
credibility. No credibility, no knowledge. Never pure chapter 2

Neither space nor bodies should, strictly speaking, be regarded as
"factors": no space, no science; no bodies, no science. And so too 
with credibility. Science, like finance, is a credit-economy: these
are activities in which, if you subtract credibility, there is just
no product left—neither a currency nor a body of scientific knowledge.
Skepticism in science is like a run on the currency.

In practice, the natural philosopher does not care what happened to
this mercury in this piece of glass apparatus on this day and at this
place, except as these outcomes support inferences to the relatively
nonlocal and nonspecific.

But in order for specific findings to be about the atmosphere or about
the universe, the credibility of these standing-for relationships has
to be accepted. Elements in these relationships are not logically
connected, and the metonymic connections between them are defeasible
in principle.

For example, one reader may think that peer review as currently 
practised is important because it forces scientists to read and
review each other’s work, and without peer review they will spend
less time on such tasks. This is discussed in Section 3.2. Another
reader may worry that without peer review and the journal publications
that go with them it will be more difficult to evaluate scientists for
hiring or promotion (Section 3.5).

Por fin algo de descencia, Liam Kofi Bright is peer review a good idea?

Me parece más que claro que hemos heredado no sólo los métodos, sino
la cloaca que es el trabajo de investigación científica.
