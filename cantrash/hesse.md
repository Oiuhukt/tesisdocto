"in applications of induction, are already known not to be identical 
in all respects. That is to say the assumption, made in Carnap's type 
of inference, that the evidence ascribes to the individuals only the
same property P1 in both cases, and that there are not initially known
to be any differences between them, is at best an idealization of the
real situation. It will generally be the case that, if the total 
evidence is taken into account, superficially similar instances will 
be found to be different in some respects." p. 320


"It follows from this theorem that neither of the analogical arguments
(a) and (b) are justifiable within Carnap's A-system. This means that
a large number of similarities between instances as in (a), and a 
large number of occurrences of the same correlation in otherwise different
instances as in (b), both fail to give increasing confirmation as 
these numbers respectively increase."

Porque si tomamos absolutamente toda la evidencia, obviamente los 
analogandos van a ser muy diferentes entre sí, dados todos sus 
aspectos. Además, es plausible pensar que uno de los analogandos en
realidad tenga una relación más cercana con C que con B. Si tomamos
toda la evidencia, estas inferencias no están justificadas en el 
cálculo de Carnap
