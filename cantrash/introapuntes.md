oArchimedes was probably the first mathematician candid enough to explain that there is a difference between the way theorems are discovered and the way they are proved. 

ne of the philosophical theses in favor of the contraposition between the internalist approach and the externalist approach is the so-called doctrine of the two contexts, developed by positivism.

became the only aspect relevant to the history of science. The consideration of non-rational, external factors, according to this position, not only fails to increase our understanding of scientific development, but even obscures the fundamental question of the rational validation of scientific arguments. p.75

The search for new explanatory programs is characterized above all by the attempt to reconcile the internalist and externalist approaches. But, in view of the fact that both approaches are committed to theses concerning the nature of science that are not only incompatible, but are unsustainable, their union without important changes in their philosophical presuppositions cannot result in a viable program. p. 79

The general tendency in the historiography of the sciences is to consider the social function of science, as weIl as so me aspects of the matrix from wh ich the problematic is formed, as external elements, while the conceptual apparatus and the problem field are treated as internal. But we should not think of science as having two independent histories.

External factors are not only found in the context of discovery, they are present also in the development of the concepts, problems, methods, problem fields, etc. of scientific discourses: that is, external factors are present in the context of validation itself. There are scientific discourses in which ideological conceptions pass on to form part of the body of the science itself, functioning as principles which define its field of study or guide its research; thus, external factors can become internal. p. 85

This conception constitutes the dominant framework in which the philosophy of science has been developed, and consists in drawing a radlcal distinction between the context of discovery and the context of validation. p. 75

This has certain risks, such as making the mathematics look simpler
than it really was in its time, but the risk of obscuring ideas by cumber-
some, unfamiliar notation is greater, in my opinion. Indeed, it is practically
a truism that mathematical ideas generally arise before there is notation or
language to express them clearly, and that ideas are implicit before they
become explicit. Thus the historian, who is presumably trying to be both
clear and explicit, often has no choice but to be anachronistic when tracing
the origins of ideas.


Perhaps the low cultural status of mathematics today, not to mention
the mathematical ignorance of politicians and philosophers, reflects the
lack of an Elements suitable for the modern world

When mathematicians returned to problems of finding limits in
the 17th century, they found no use for the rigorous methods of the Greeks.
The dubious 17th-century methods of infinitesimals were criticized by the
Zeno of the time, Bishop Berkeley, but little was done to meet his objec-
tions until much later, since infinitesimals did not seem to lead to incorrect
results. It was Dedekind, Weierstrass, and others in the 19th century who
eventually restored Greek standards of rigor.

The story of rigor lost and rigor regained took an amazing turn when
a previously unknown manuscript of Archimedes, The Method, was dis-
covered in 1906. In it he reveals that his deepest results were found using
dubious infinitary arguments, and only later proved rigorously. Because, as
he says, “It is of course easier to supply the proof when we have previously
acquired some knowledge of the questions by the method, than it is to find
it without any previous knowledge.”
The importance of this statement goes beyond its revelation that infinity
can be used to discover results that are not initially accessible to logic.
Archimedes was probably the first mathematician candid enough to explain
that there is a difference between the way theorems are discovered and the
way they are proved.

Thus a fictive definitive system of knowledge was made the basis of epistemological inquiry, with the result that the schematized character of this basis was soon forgotten, and the fictive construction was identified with the actual system. 
It is one of the elementary laws of approximative procedure that the consequences drawn from a schematized conception do not hold outside the limits of the approximation; that in particular no consequences may be drawn from features belonging to the nature of the schematization only and not to the coordinated object.

for many a purpose the number tt maybe sufficiently approximated by the value 22/7; to infer from this, however, that tt is a rational number is by no means permissible. Many of the inferences of traditional epistemology and of positivism as well, I must confess, do not appear much better to me. It is particularly the domain of the verifiability conception of meaning and of questions connected with it, such as the problem of the existence of external things, which has been overrun with paralogisms of this type.

The final theory has to be in fair agreement with observations and also has to be sufficiently simple to be usable. If we consider this point, it is obvious that such a theory cannot be "the truth." In modern science, a theory is regarded as an instrument that serves toward some definite purpose. It has to be helpful in predicting future observable facts on the basis of facts that have been observed in the past and the present. It should also be helpful in the construction of machines and devices that can save us time and labor. A scientific theory is : in a sense, a tool that produces other tools according to a practical scheme. 

In Corder to obtain a basis from which one can pronounce sound judgment about this situation, one should put the question: In what sense does science search for the "truth" about the universe? This "truth" certainly does not consist of "facts" but of general hypotheses or theories. 

What we call "facts" in the strictly empirical sense, without any admixture of theory, are, in the last analysis, sense impressions between which no connection is given.

Hence, the question of what we have to regard as the "truth" about the universe has to be formulated rather as follows: "What are the criteria under which we accept a hypothesis or a theory?" 

If we put this or a similar question, we shall see soon that these criteria will contain, to a certain extent, the psychological and sociological characteristics of the scientist, because they are relevant for the acceptance of any doctrine. 

In other words, the validation of "theories" cannot be separated neatly from the values which the scientist accepts. 
This is true in all fields of science, over the whole spectrum ranging from geometry and mechanics to psychoanalysis.


sical conception, the aim of science is the discovery of an existing 'true' world, while according to the positivist, however, it is the  construction of a system of statements with the help of which we can  find our way in the world of our experiences. Planck finds fault with  the latter conception: the passion and readiness for sacrifice with  which men like Galileo have fought for their convictions could not be  understood if the matter had been merely purposeful, useful, constructions and not the discovery of truth.

The events around Galileo make it clear that the passionate conflicts  connected with a physical theory have nothing to do with its suitability  to represent natural processes but much more with their relationships  to the political and social events of the time. Therefore there is no need  to amplify the positivist conception of science by a metaphysical  concept of truth but only by a more comprehensive study of the  connections that exist between the activity of the invention of theories  and the other normal human activities.


. In this, I kept mainly to the formulations of Russian Marxists because the connection between theory and  political practice is closest in their case. (p. 15) the law of causality and its limits Fuck me

arly years of its existence appears in Chapter III. Here we find the synthesis of positivism  and the new logic explicitly presented. It is also  interesting that since the rigorously logical formulation of the positivistic ideas, their connection with  American pragmatism has become clearly revealed; in  this essay this connection is distinctly emphasized.  


In particular, Charles  W . Morris of Chicago recognized the connection  with American pragmatism and publicized the idea  of cooperation between the two groups. It was decided, for the purpose of this cooperation, to call a  special congress, for which the name "Congress for  the Unity of Science" was coined by Otto Neurath.  A preliminary conference in preparation for this congress took place in 1934 in Prague. C. W . Morris said  there: "The doctrine of the Vienna Circle is 'logical  positivism,' that of the American pragmatists is 'biological positivism'." For the result of the cooperation  of the two, Morris suggested the name "logical empiricism," which has been generally adopted in the  United States.


Obviously, fitnessto support a desirable conduct of citizens or, briefly,to support moral behavior, has served through the ages as a reason for acceptance of a theory. When the "scientific criterions" did not uniquely determine a theory, its fitness to support moral or political indoctrination became an important factor for its acceptance. 
It is important to learn that the interpretationof a scientifictheoryas a support of moral rules is not
a rare case but has played a role in all periods of history.

This book aims to treat all questions put in it without this opium  that is often called 'philosophy', by misuse of an honourable name.  Nowhere will we attempt to make unsettled questions appear as if they  were settled, by the use of dazzling turns of phrase; moreover,  nowhere will we attempt to avoid questions concerning the borders of  the area commonly called 'science', by shifting to another plane. Much  more, our object is to treat all problems that appear during the  operation of science with the same striving toward real solutions to  which one is accustomed within the fields called often with benign  condescension the 'special sciences'.

. Nevertheless, many educators and political leaders were afraid that denial of the exceptional status of the celestial bodies in physical science would make it more difficult to teach the belief in the existence of spiritual beings as distinct from material bodies; and since it was their general conviction that the belief in spiritual beings is a powerful instrument to bring about a desirable conduct among citizens, a physical theory that supported this belief seemed to be highly desirable. 

l these factors participate in the making of a scientific theory. We remember, however, that according to the opinion of the majority of active scientists, these extrascientific factors "should not" have any influence on the acceptance of a scientific theory. But who has claimed and who can claim that they "should not"?

. Technological changes have to produce social changes that manifest themselves in changing human conduct. Everybody knows of the Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century and the accompanying changes in human life from a rural into an urban patten^ Probably the rise of atomic power will produce analogous changaf in man's way of life.
