5.2 The S-R Model

According to the S-R model, in order to explain an event one must exhibit all the factors that are statistically relevant to its happening, without mentioning irrelevant elements, so that an explanatory account should include only information that is genuinely explanatory. In order to accomplish this task, the event explanandum must be referred to a homogeneous reference class, namely to the class containing all and only the relevant properties. Homogeneity is obtained through statistically relevant partitions of non-homogeneous reference classes into mutually exclusive and exhaustive sub-classes. Statistical relevance, providing the tool to attain homogeneity, is defined as follows. 

\begin{definition}

Let A stand for the reference class including some event of which one wants to establish the probability of possessing the property B; p(B∣A) be the probability of B within the reference class A, and C be another property by which the class A can be divided into two sub-classes (A&C) and (A&∼C); the property C is statistically relevant with respect to B in A if and only if p(B&C∣A)≠p(B∣A)

\end{definition}

A homogeneous partition of a reference class does not admit further relevant partitions, and the resulting sub-classes must be maximal, in the sense that no irrelevant properties are retained.

In some cases partitioning a reference class A can result in two sub-classes (A&C) and (A&∼C) both homogeneous with respect to a given property B. This means that property B is held by all elements belonging to class (A&C), but none of the elements belonging to (A&∼C). In all other cases the class A will be partitioned into k homogeneous sub-classes (A&Ck)

such that
p(B∣A&Ci)≠p(B∣A&Cj),

for i≠j

. Such a procedure is the content of a rule of multiple homogeneity which “expresses the fundamental condition for adequate explanation of particular events” (Salmon 1970b [1971: 59]). Fulfillment of this rule guarantees against the inclusion of irrelevant information in the explanatory account. Once the process leading to the specification of a homogeneous reference class is completed, the event to be explained is associated with a probability distribution. The shift from a non-homogeneous to a homogeneous reference class embodies the explanatory power of the S-R model, according to which

    an explanation is an assemblage of factors that are statistically relevant to the occurrence of the event to be explained, accompanied by an associated probability distribution. (Salmon 1979c: 68)

The shift in question involves an increase in information, although not necessarily an increase in probability. Given that Salmon does not require relevance to be positive, the procedure described can result in a higher as well as a lower probability of the explanandum. In this perspective what counts for the sake of explanation is not high probability, as required by Hempel, but being in a position to assert that the probability distribution associated with the explanandum reflects the most complete and detailed information attainable. This information is conveyed by a homogeneous partition of the reference class, together with a statement specifying to which cell of that partition the explanandum event belongs.

As observed (§ 2.1), the objective homogeneity of the reference class is an ideal not free from difficulties, because one can hardly ever be sure to have taken into account all relevant information. Well aware of this, Salmon admits that in practice

    we often lack full knowledge of the properties relevant to a given attribute, so we do not know whether our reference class is homogeneous or not. (Salmon 1970b [1971: 44])

Therefore, in most cases use is made of epistemically homogeneous reference classes, namely those relative to a given knowledge situation.


## 5.3 Explanations vs. Arguments

Salmon rejected Hempel’s tenet that an explanation is an argument, which he deemed the “third dogma of empiricism” (Salmon 1977a [1998]). His main objection was that although irrelevancies are harmless to arguments, they are fatal to explanations. In Salmon’s words:

    Inference, whether deductive or inductive, demands a requirement of total evidence—a requirement that all relevant evidence be mentioned in the premises. This requirement, which has substantive importance for inductive inferences, is automatically satisfied for deductive inferences. Explanation, in contrast, seems to demand a further requirement—namely, that only considerations relevant to the explanandum be contained in the explanans. (Salmon 1977a [1998: 104])

Furthermore, arguments are not well suited to account for explanatory asymmetry, for there is a disparity of temporal asymmetry in explanations and in arguments that makes the latter fit for prediction and retrodiction, but unfit for explanation. Take for instance a lunar eclipse, which can be predicted on the basis of the laws of motion and a suitable set of initial conditions holding prior to it. The same eclipse can also be retrodicted making use of posterior conditions and the same laws. However, explanations are temporally asymmetric in a very specific sense: they go from antecedent conditions to subsequent events. Such asymmetry is not embodied by arguments, which often move in the opposite direction. There emerges a divergence between prediction, which is an inferential activity, and explanation, which is not.

The asymmetry of explanation reflects that of causation, which for Salmon is the key to a satisfactory explanatory account. While knowledge of correlations is usually sufficient to bolster prediction, explanation requires more, namely establishing causal relations between events. A favorite example mentioned by Salmon is that of “the barometer and the storm”. Based on the correlation between the behavior of the barometer and the occurrence of storms, one can predict a storm after having observed a sudden drop in the barometer, but nobody would say that the drop in the barometer explains the storm. In similar situations one would look for causal information, such as the sudden drop in atmospheric pressure in the area surrounding the occurrence of the storm. On the one hand, not all statistically relevant properties convey causal information; on the other, statistical correlations themselves invoke an explanation. In view of this, in the course of the Seventies Salmon gradually came to the conclusion that the S-R model cannot substantiate a satisfactory account of explanation. In a paper entitled “Why Ask ‘Why?’?” he maintained:

    I no longer believe that the assemblage of relevant factors provides a complete explanation—or much of anything in the way of an explanation. We do, I believe, have a bona fide explanation of an event if we have a complete set of statistically relevant factors, the pertinent probability values, and causal explanations of the relevance relations (1978a [1998: 137]).




2.3 Kolmogorov's axiomatization

Andrej Nikolaevich Kolmogorov was born in 1903 in Tomboy,
where his mother stopped on a journey to the Crimea, and died
in Moscow in 1987. After his mother died in childbirth, he was
raised by his aunt, and by the time he enrolled at the
university of Moscow in 1920, he had developed an interest in
Russian history. Soon after he started his career as a
student, he became extremely fond of mathematics, and was
able, within a short time, to obtain original results. In
1924, he started a fruitful collaboration with Alexandr
Yakovlevich Khinchin, with whom he did important work on
convergent series and the law of large numbers. Kolmogorov gave substantial contributions to various branches of
probability and statistics, and is considered one of the most
influential mathematicians of the last century. He was for
many years professor of mathematics at Moscow State
University, and member of prestigious institutions all over
the world.
In 1933, Kolmogorov's famous monograph Grundbegriffe der
Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung was published, where an axiomatic
approach to probability is spelled out. This is inspired by
the conviction that

\begin{quote}
The theory of probability, as a mathematical discipline,
can and should be developed from axioms in exactly the
same way as Geometry and Algebra. This means that after we
have defined the elements to be studied and their basic
relations, and have stated the axioms by which these
relations are to be governed, all further exposition must
be based exclusively on these axioms, independent of the
usual concrete meaning of these elements and their
relations (Kolmogorov 1933, English edition 1950, p. 1).
\end{quote}

The axiomatization was meant to shed light on the basic
mathematical properties of probability, and to draw a
distinction between probability's formal features and the
meaning it receives in practical situations. As a result of
Kolmogorov's axiomatization, `probability theory acquired an
equitable position among other mathematical disciplines'
(Maistrov 1974, p. 262).
