* Recently, Vaidya and Wallner (2021) have further refined the General
  question by splitting it into two different questions:

	* Access question: How can we epistemically access the modal
	realm?

	* Navigation question: How should we navigate from one kind of
	modality to another?


* Some philosophers have recently approached the epistemology of
  metaphysical modality by first investigating whether some every-day
  propositions are practically possible (as opposed to metaphysically
  possible) (e.g., Strohminger 2015 and Vetter forthcoming). Whether
  some proposition p is practically possible hinges on some specific
  circumstances that are held fixed in a situation—for example, given
  a particular subject’s physical abilities, or certain environmental
  conditions. While it seems uncontroversial that it is metaphysically
  possible to get the couch to the other side of the room, a specific
  subject might wonder whether it is practically possible for her to do
  so, given certain circumstances.

* This raises a Navigation Question: How are we to epistemically navigate
  from practical modality to metaphysical modality? Given that we know
  that p is practically possible, how do we come to know that it is
  metaphysically possible? Is this done via some (implicit or explicit)
  inferential transition? If so, does that imply that we need knowledge of
  some bridge principle between practical and metaphysical possibility?

<!--- Dos proyectos. Uno relacionado con cuáles métodos conducen a la
verdad (normativo) y uno relacionado con cómo obtenemos conocimientomodal
(descriptivo). Supongamos que la _imaginación_ es un método medianteel
cual obtenemos conocimiento modal. Pero la imaginmación sin restricciones
no es fiable (conducente a la verdad). Aquí es importante involucrarel
concepto de _epistemic friction creators__ ---->

* The descriptive task does not in itself involve answering the question
  of how the processes are truth-conducive. This question takes center
  stage in the normative task, which targets the correctness conditions
  for such processes and methods. More precisely, a chief normative task
  for the epistemology of modality is to elucidate what constrains such
  processes or methods, i.e., in virtue of what their outputs are correct
  or incorrect. As a normative inquiry, the epistemology of modality is
  centrally concerned with what Vaidya and Wallner (2021) call the Problem
  of Modal Epistemic Friction (PMEF). This problem concerns the normative
  restrictions on candidate capacities or methods. 

<!---Una distinción importante. En lógica modal la posibilidad y la
necesidad son interdefinibles. Podemos tomar a uno de los operadores
modales como básico.¿Procede de la misma manera nuestro conocimiento de
modalidades? Es decir, ¿conocemos primero hechos que son meramente
posibles y derivamos (digamos inferencialmente), hechos necesarios?,
o viceversa --->

* Kripke _necesidades a psoteriori_. Kant _a priori coincide con
  necesario_.

* In general, modal rationalists prioritize a priori methods for acquiring
  knowledge of metaphysical modality.

* By contrast, modal empiricists pursue a posteriori accounts of knowledge
  of metaphysical modality. Often they still acknowledge that a priori
  methods might contribute to modal knowledge. (See Fischer & Leon 2017)

* Some philosophers have challenged the philosophical significance of the
  a priori/a posteriori distinction (e.g., Hawthorne 2007; Sosa 2013;
  Williamson 2007, 2013; for discussion: Casullo 2015). We discuss
  Williamson’s version of the challenge in §4.2.

<!---_The integration problem_ si nuestra metafísica modal señala quelos
mundos posibles están causalmente aislados, entonces la conexión entre
nuestra justificación de dichos hechos es misteriosa (El problema de
Benacerraf). El segundo problema _The reliability problem_ Señala que si
estamos justificados en tener conocimiento modal, este debe provenir de
ciertas facultades humanas, mejor explicadas por una teoría evolutiva
--->


<!---- La modalidad es la _forma (para no repetir modo)_ en que pueden ser
las cosas. Ciertas proposiciones son posibles o necesarias. Que "2+2=4" es
una verdad necesaria. Por otro lado "Oscar está esté escribiendo esto", no
es necesario ya que podría ser falso (podría estar haciendo otra cosa).
Esto, por supuesto está cuantificando sobre oraciones. Otras
caracterizaciones modales pretenden determinar el modo en cómo son las
cosas (modalidad de re). ---->

* Por supuesto, nuestro conocmiento modal depende de qué tipo de modalidad
  estamos hablando. Regularmente hay una imagen _anidada_ de cómo se
  relacionan diferentes tipos d emodalidad. La estructura clásica de dicha
  imágen es que el conjunto más grande es el de la modalidad lógica, como
  subconjunto propio está la modalidad metafísica, y como subconjunto
  propio de esta última está la modalidad física. Por supuesto hay autores
  que empatan la modalidad metafísica y la física. 

* Necesitamos fricción epistémica para no dejar a la imaginación volar
  (agua sin hidrógeno). 

* The Dependence Question: Suppose conceivability does provide
  justification for believing that something is possible. Does it succeed
  in doing so because conceivability operates on some prior beliefs about
  the considered scenario? For example, does conceivability guide one to
  the belief that a round square is impossible because one knows what
  squares and circles are, and by examining their definition one can
  arrive safely at the conclusion that such objects are impossible?
  Similarly, does one simply find water in the absence of hydrogen
  possible because one either suppresses the knowledge that water contains
  hydrogen or one does not know that water does contain hydrogen? In the
  first case, conceivability would seem to depend, to an important extent
  on, underlying linguistic or conceptual knowledge (along the lines of
  analytic accounts of the a priori more generally). In the second case,
  conceivability would depend on both linguistic or conceptual knowledge
  and empirical knowledge. In both cases, additional essentialist
  knowledge might be needed (e.g., Kment 2021; Goff 2021; and Roca-Royes
  2011a). In Vaidya and Wallner’s (2021), (§2), the critical point of the
  Dependence Question is the following: In order for our conceivability
  exercises to appropriately justify our modal judgments, those
  conceivability exercises need to be constrained by some crucial
  information about the (essence of) the entities involved in them,
  creating the needed epistemic friction for conceivability. In effect,
  the Dependence Question is concerned with the issue of the source of
  modal knowledge. Is conceivability an ultimate source of modal
  knowledge, or is it derivative, namely dependent on another source, such
  as linguistic or conceptual knowledge and essentialist knowledge? (see
  also Berto & Schoonen 2018). 

  * Williamson supports the thesis that knowledge of metaphysical modality
    is a special case of imaginative counterfactual knowledge with logical
    equivalences between sentences using counterfactual operators and
    modal operators, aimed at showing that statements of possibility and
    necessity can be reformulated in counterfactual terms in
    a straightforward way: 
    
>    (NEC) □ A iff ( ¬ A □ → ⊥) (it is necessary that A iff if it were not
>    the case that A a contradiction would follow)
>
>    (POS) ◊ A iff  ¬ ( A □ → ⊥)  (it is possible that A iff it is not the
>    case that if A were true a contradiction would follow) 


Thus, we can identify the following two key theses in Williamson’s
counterfactual theory:


>  Logical Equivalence: metaphysical possibility and necessity can be
>  proven to be logically equivalent to counterfactual conditionals.
>
>  Epistemic Pathway: the method of counterfactual development carried out
>  in imagination can provide one with knowledge of metaphysical
>  modality.

* The two are importantly interconnected in that Epistemic Pathway is partly
based on Logical Equivalence.

* Essence is needed to make a plausible theory of modal knowledge. If we
  know essential properties, then we know necessary properties.

* Vaidya (2010) has proposed an account of our knowledge of essence that
  is influenced by Husserl’s (1973) method of eidetic variation, according
  to which we get access to the essence of an object by varying its
  features in imagination. If a feature is seen to be invariant, then it
  is an essence. In contrast to other essentialists discussed here, Vaidya
  explicitly targets understanding and not knowledge of essence.
  (Following Kvanvig 2009, Vaidya takes understanding [but not knowledge]
  to be compatible with epistemic luck.) Taking Husserl’s ideas only as
  a point of departure, Vaidya holds that we can gain understanding of the
  essence of some object x by varying properties of x in our imagination.
  Of those properties that are invariant over the multiplicity of
  variations, we judge that they are essential to x . (See Wallner
  forthcoming for a discussion of Husserl’s epistemology of essence in
  contrast to that of Lowe and Hale, and Michels (2020) for a critical
  discussion of Vaidya.)
