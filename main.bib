Our question in this paper will be how best to formulate a theory of this kind. We'll argue that an acceptable MRL should (i) avoid inter-system comparisons of simplicity, strength, and balance, (ii) make lawhood epistemically accessible, and (iii) allow for laws in the special sciences. Attention to these problems will bring into focus a useful menu of novel MRL theories, some of which solve problems the original MRL theory could not. Hence we conceive of the paper as moving toward a better Best System theory of laws.},

The two propositions -- (1) truth is the only intrinsic epistemic good, and (2) knowledge is better than mere true belief -- cannot, according to the writer, both be true. Since (2) is obviously true, we must reject (1), and embrace value pluralism, which asserts that in addition to truth, there are further intrinsic goods, such as knowledge and justification.}

  abstract     = {An adaptationist programme has dominated evolutionary thought in England and the United States during the past 40 years. It is based on faith in the power of  natural selection as an optimizing agent. It proceeds by breaking an oragnism  into unitary 'traits' and proposing an adaptive story for each considered  separately. Trade-offs among competing selective demands exert the only brake  upon perfection; non-optimality is thereby rendered as a result of adaptation as  well. We criticize this approach and attempt to reassert a competing notion (long  popular in continental Europe) that organisms must be analysed as integrated  wholes, with Baupl{\"a}ne so constrained by phyletic heritage, pathways of  development and general architecture that the constraints themselves become more  interesting and more important in delimiting pathways of change than the  selective force that may mediate change when it occurs. We fault the  adaptationist programme for its failure to distinguish current utility from  reasons for origin (male tyrannosaurs may have used their diminutive front legs  to titillate female partners, but this will not explain why they got so small);  for its unwillingness to consider alternatives to adaptive stories; for its  reliance upon plausibility alone as a criterion for accepting speculative tales;  and for its failure to consider adequately such competing themes as random  fixation of alleles, production of non-adaptive structures by developmental  correlation with selected features (allometry, pleiotropy, material compensation,  mechanically forced correlation), the separability of adaptation and selection,  multiple adaptive peaks, and current utility as an epiphenomenon of non-adaptive  structures. We support Darwin's own pluralistic approach to identifying the  agents of evolutionary change.},

This paper argues that defeasible infinitism provides a good way to characterize real knowledge and it shows how real knowledge can arise from fallible justification. Then, I argue that there are two ways of interpreting Ernest Sosa's account of real knowledge as belief that is aptly formed and capable of being fully defended. On the one hand, if beliefs are aptly formed only if they have a specific causal etiology, namely that they are efficiently caused fully or partially by virtuous characteristics of the epistemic agent, then Sosa's account falls prey to what I call the problem of the Hazard of Empirical Disconfirmation (HED). The HED problem applies to all forms of causal accounts of real knowledge and is simply that as we gain more empirical knowledge about the causal origins of our true beliefs that are the most highly prized we will discover that they do not always (or even hardly ever) satisfy the required efficient causal constraints. Bluntly put, having sufficiently good reasons for our beliefs might not require that the beliefs have the requisite efficient causal etiology. On the other hand, there is a way of interpreting Sosa's views that does not include an efficient causal prerequisite. That interpretation makes Sosa's account of real knowledge almost identical to defeasible infinitism but expressed in an alternate vocabulary. Such a view is not subject to the HED problem and it can solve the deep problem in epistemology, namely how to get epistemically certain (as opposed to psychologically certain) knowledge from fallible justification.},

Equally, several widely-held realist theses about the nature of inter-theoretic relations and scientific progress are scrutinized and found wanting. Finally, it is argued that the history of science, far from confirming scientific realism, decisively confutes several extant versions of avowedly 'naturalistic' forms of scientific realism.}

They make especially illuminating remarks on the problems of partitioning variances and covariances among groups such as social classes and races. The most important point of all, at least from the standpoint of the practical, social, and political applications of human population genetics, occurs at the conclusion of the first paper1 in which Morton points out explicitly the chief programmatic fallacy committed by those who argue so strongly for the importance of heritability measures for human traits. The fallacy is that a knowledge of the heritability of some trait in a population provides an index of the efficacy of environmental or clinical intervention in altering the trait either in individuals or in the population as a whole. This fallacy, sometimes propagated even by geneticists, who should know better, arises from the confusion between the technical meaning of heritablility and the everyday meaning of the word. A trait can have a heritability of 1.0 in a population at some time, yet this could be completely altered in the future by a simple environmental change. If this were not the case, `inborn errors of metabolism' would be forever incurable, which is patently untrue. But the misunderstanding about the relationship between heritability and phenotypic plasticity is not simply the result of an ignorance of genetics on the part of psychologists and electronic engineers. It arises from the entire system of analysis of causes through linear models, embodied in the analysis of variance and covariance and in path analysis. It is indeed ironic that while Morton and his colleagues dispute the erroneous programmatic conclusions that are drawn from the analysis of human phenotypic variation, they nevertheless rely heavily for their analytic techniques on the very linear models that are responsible for the confusion.}

  abstract     = {Mounting failures of replication in social and biological sciences give a new urgency to critically appraising proposed reforms. This book pulls back the cover on disagreements between experts charged with restoring integrity to science. It denies two pervasive views of the role of probability in inference: to assign degrees of belief, and to control error rates in a long run. If statistical consumers are unaware of assumptions behind rival evidence reforms, they can't scrutinize the consequences that affect them (in personalized medicine, psychology, etc.). The book sets sail with a simple tool: if little has been done to rule out flaws in inferring a claim, then it has not passed a severe test. Many methods advocated by data experts do not stand up to severe scrutiny and are in tension with successful strategies for blocking or accounting for cherry picking and selective reporting. Through a series of excursions and exhibits, the philosophy and history of inductive inference come alive. Philosophical tools are put to work to solve problems about science and pseudoscience, induction and falsification.}

In particular, I argue that the right conception of veritism--one that is fundamentally informed by the intellectual virtues--has none of the problematic consequences that Elgin claims. Relatedly, I maintain that we can account for the core role of objectual understanding in inquiry without thereby giving up on truth as the fundamental epistemic good (and even while granting that such understanding might well involve some false beliefs on the part of the subject).}

It approaches the notion of representation in a deflationary spirit, and minimally characterizes the concept as it appears in science by means of two necessary conditions: its essential directionality and its capacity to allow surrogate reasoning and inference. The conception is defended by showing that it successfully meets the objections that make its competitors, such as isomorphism and similarity, untenable. In addition the inferential conception captures the objectivity of the cognitive representations used by science, it sheds light on their truth and completeness, and it explains the source of the analogy between scientific and artistic modes of representation.},

  abstract     = {Scientific realism is a central, long-standing, and hotly debated topic in philosophy of science. Debates about scientific realism concern the very nature and extent of scientific knowledge and progress. Scientific realists defend a positive epistemic attitude towards our best theories and models regarding how they represent the world that is unobservable to our naked senses. Various realist theses are under sceptical fire from scientific antirealists, e.g. empiricists and instrumentalists. The different dimensions of the ensuing debate centrally connect to numerous other topics in philosophy of science and beyond. The Routledge Handbook of Scientific Realism is an outstanding reference source ? the first collection of its kind ? to the key issues, positions, and arguments in this important topic.\&nbsp;Its thirty-four chapters, written\&nbsp;by a team of international experts, are\&nbsp;divided into five parts: Historical development of the realist stance Classic debate: core issues and positions Perspectives on contemporary debates The realism debate in disciplinary context Broader reflections In these sections, the core\&nbsp;issues and\&nbsp;debates presented, analysed, and set into broader historical and disciplinary contexts.\&nbsp;The central issues covered include motivations and arguments for realism; challenges to realism from underdetermination and history of science; different variants of realism; the connection of realism to relativism\&nbsp;and perspectivism; and the relationship between realism, metaphysics, and epistemology. The Routledge Handbook of Scientific Realism is essential reading for students and researchers in philosophy of science. It will also be very useful for anyone interested in the nature and extent of scientific knowledge.},

  abstract     = {The book develops a conception of epistemology in which the notion of knowledge is explanatorily fundamental. It reverses the traditional programme of trying to analyse knowledge as a combination of truth, belief, and other factors, such as justification. Rather, belief is a state whose successful form is knowledge, and justification is on the basis of knowledge, which is acquainted with evidence. Knowing is as much a mental state as believing, but it is world-involving because one can know only what is true; the book extends the externalist conception of mind from the contents of mental states to the attitudes to those contents. As with other mental states, one cannot always know whether one is in the state of knowing. It is argued that this is a special case of a much more general phenomenon; no non-trivial conditions are such that one is always in a position to know that they obtain whenever they in fact do so. This result has disturbing implications for the nature of rationality, because one is not always in a position to know what it is rational to do. Traditional arguments for scepticism fail because they assume that one is always in a position to know what one's evidence is. The speech act of assertion is also governed by a norm of knowledge. A final chapter explores the limits on what can be known that are revealed by the so-called paradox of knowability.}

  abstract     = {1 Four methods of determining the potential difference across the surface membrane of living cells are described. 2 In a wide range of excitable tissues the resting membrane potential is of the order of 50–100 mV. and the action potential of the order of 80–130 mV. 3 At the height of activity the potential difference across the membrane is reversed by 30–50 mV. 4 The potassium concentration inside most excitable cells is 20–50 times greater than that in the external medium; sodium is 3–15 times more concentrated outside than it is inside, while chloride is 5–50 times more concentrated outside than inside. Isolated fibres lose potassium and gain sodium and chloride ions. 5 Potassium appears to exist as a free ion inside nerve and muscle fibres. 6 The nature of the organic anions which balance the high concentration of potassium inside excitable cells is still largely unknown. In certain cases amino-acids such as aspartic acid are present in high concentrations. 7 The resting membrane behaves as though it were moderately permeable to K+ and Cl- but sparingly permeable to Na+. The absolute magnitude of the resting potential is similar to that calculated from the potassium concentrations if allowance is made for the contributions of chloride and other ions. Movements of K+ and Cl- as determined by radioactive tracers or by chemical methods agree with a quantitative formulation of this hypothesis. 8 It is necessary to suppose that sodium is continuously pumped out of excitable cells by a process which depends on metabolism. 9 Electrical activity is due to a large and specific increase in the permeability to sodium. The reversed potential difference across the active membrane arises from the concentration difference of sodium and varies with the external concentration of sodium in the same manner as the theoretical potential of a sodium electrode. 10 In many cells, conduction of impulses is impossible if the external medium does not contain sodium or lithium ions. 11 The rate of rise of the action potential varies with the concentration of sodium ions in the external medium. 12 Sodium enters a nerve fibre when it is active. The quantity entering 1 cm.2 of membrane during one impulse is of the order of 3 μμmol. 13 Entry of sodium is approximately balanced by the leakage of a corresponding quantity of potassium. 14 It is suggested that sodium enters the nerve fibre during the rising phase of the action potential and that potassium leaves during the falling phase. 15 The permeability changes during the action potential probably consist of a rapid but transient increase in the permeability to sodium and a delayed increase in the permeability to potassium. It is suggested that both permeability changes vary with membrane potential in a graded but reversible manner. This hypothesis is applied to the phenomena of subthreshold activity, accomodation and oscillatory behaviour. 16 In vertebrate myelinated fibres there is much evidence to show that conduction is saltatory; this suggests that sodium entry is confined to the nodes of Ranvier, and that the internodes are depolarized by local circuit action. 17 Provided that nerves are not stimulated at a high rate, recovery heat production is sufficient to account for the metabolic extrusion of sodium after activity.},

  abstract     = {Idealization is commonly understood as distortion: representing things differently than how they actually are. In this paper, we outline an alternative artifactual approach that does not make misrepresentation central for the analysis of idealization. We examine the contrast between the Hodgkin-Huxley (1952a, b, c) and the Heimburg-Jackson (2005, 2006) models of the nerve impulse from the artifactual perspective, and argue that, since the two models draw upon different epistemic resources and research programs, it is often difficult to tell which features of a system the central assumptions involved are supposed to distort. Many idealizations are holistic in nature. They cannot be locally undone without dismantling the model, as they occupy a central position in the entire research program. Nor is their holistic character mainly related to the use of mathematical and statistical modeling techniques as portrayed by Rice (2018, 2019). We suggest that holistic idealizations are implicit theoretical and representational assumptions that can only be understood in relation to the conceptual and representational tools exploited in modeling and experimental practices. Such holistic idealizations play a pivotal role not just in individual models, but also in defining research programs.},

Contemporary historians and philosophers of science have shown an even greater reluctance to accept a dichotomy between ‘internal’ and ‘external’ factors that intervene in the development of scientific knowledge.

One of these consists in defending an ‘internalist’ position with regard to the history of science, or, at least, in supposing that internal factors have a greater relevance for science than external ones. On the other hand, there is an increasingly more serious interest in constructing a ‘new history of science’, based on the complementarity of the internalist approach and the externalist approach, and on the utilization of methods drawn from other social disciplines.},

  abstract     = {The first comprehensive defense of an inferential conception of scientific representation with applications to art and epistemology.   Mauricio Suárez develops a conception of representation that delivers a compelling account of modeling practice. He begins by discussing the history and methodology of model building, charting the emergence of what he calls the modeling attitude, a nineteenth-century and fin de siècle development. Prominent cases of models, both historical and contemporary, are used as benchmarks for the accounts of representation considered throughout the book. After arguing against reductive naturalist theories of scientific representation, Suárez sets out his own account: a case for pluralism regarding the means of representation and minimalism regarding its constituents. He shows that scientists employ a variety of modeling relations in their representational practice—which helps them to assess the accuracy of their representations—while demonstrating that there is nothing metaphysically deep about the constituent relation that encompasses all these diverse means.   The book also probes the broad implications of Suárez’s inferential conception outside scientific modeling itself, covering analogies with debates about artistic representation and philosophical thought over the past several decades.},

But first of all we take note of two underlying assumptions.TWO ASSUMPTIONS(A1) Not everything believed is known, but nothing can be known without being at least believed (or accepted, presumed, taken for granted, or the like) in some broad sense. What additional requirements must a belief fill in order to be knowledge? There are surely at least the following two: (a) it must be true, and (b) it must be justified (or warranted, reasonable, correct, or the like).(A2) Let us assume, moreover, with respect to the second condition A1(b): first, that it involves a normative or evaluative property; and, second, that the relevant sort of justification is that which pertains to knowledge: epistemic (or theoretical) justification. Someone seriously ill may have two sorts of justification for believing he will recover: the practical justification that derives from the contribution such belief will make to his recovery and the theoretical justification provided by the lab results, the doctor's diagnosis and prognosis, and so on. Only the latter is relevant to the question whether he knows.},

I argue that, while both of them explain the data on our knowledge of counterfactuals, neither can subsume modal knowledge. (EC) would be available only to extreme haecceitists. Only (W) — Williamson's epistemology — is compatible with all counterpossibles being true; something on which Williamson's account relies. A first problem is that, in the absence of further data for (W) and against (EC), Williamson's choice of (W) is objectionably biased. A second, deeper problem is that (W) cannot satisfactorily elucidate modal knowledge. Third, from a naturalistic perspective, the nature of this second problem favours (EC) against (W).},

The resulting theory is a species of counterfactual theory that (I claim) avoids the difficulties and counterexamples that have infected alternative accounts of causation and explanation, from the Deductive-Nomological model onwards. One of the key concepts in this theory is the notion of an intervention, which is an idealization of the notion of an experimental manipulation that is stripped of its anthropocentric elements. This notion is used to provide a characterization of causal relationships that is non-reductive but also not viciously circular. Relationships that correctly tell us how the value of one variable Y would change under interventions on a second variable Y are invariant. The notion of an invariant relationship is more helpful than the notion of a law of nature (the notion on which philosophers have traditionally relied) in understanding how explanation and causal attribution work in the special sciences.}
